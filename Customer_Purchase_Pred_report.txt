
# Business Context:-
->Marketing costs money for ads , emails , discounts , coupons.
->Sending offers to everyone is a waste.
->Company wants to focus only on likely buyers.

In short , the company is trying to optimize the cost.

->Sending same ads/emails to all users is equal to a poor ROI.
->So the question of the company may be - Whom should we target?

# Business Objective:-

- Increase conversion rate while reducing unnecessary marketing costs.
  This means :- Spend less money and get more purchases -> This is the real goal of the company.

# The main thing is we are predicting the probability whether the customer will make a purchase or 
  not by observing some patterns , and this is not certainty , this is probability.

# What business problem does this project solve?
- Optimizing marketing spend.
- Improving ROI.
- Better customer targeting.

# What decision will be taken from this?
- Who gets ads , emails , discounts , and push notifications.

# What if prediction goes wrong?
- Money wasted on ads.
- Lost potential customers.

# Which is the problem type?
- It is a binary classification problem.

# What will be the final output?
- Purchase status -> 0 indicates will not buy and 1 indicates will buy.


# Project Updates:-
- Collected a few number of datasets from websites like Kaggle and to get the input features mentioned , feature engineering to be performed 
  on those data is important and we will go ahead with the final dataset we get after feature engineering.

# New dataset comments:-
- The dataset captures core behavioral signals such as page views, cart activity, session duration, and historical purchases, which are the 
  primary drivers of purchase intent. Additional attributes like device type or traffic source can improve performance but are not essential 
  for modeling user intent.

- Additional features such as cart intent, engagement score, and returning user flag were engineered to better capture user purchase intent 
  while maintaining interpretability and business relevance.

# EDA Insights:-

Insight 1: Users who added items to cart have a significantly higher conversion rate compared to users who did not add items to cart, indicating 
           that cart activity is a strong indicator of purchase intent.

Insight 2: Sessions with higher engagement scores tend to result in purchases, suggesting that deeper interaction with the platform increases 
           likelihood of conversion.

Insight 3: Returning users show higher purchase rates than first-time users, highlighting the importance of retention-focused marketing strategies.



# Questions to be answered before making the project as product-ready:-
